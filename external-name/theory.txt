application-pod -> will connect to its external-svc

- we have defined the external service to use - my-database-service's database-namespace's svc.cluster.local

- so in this way the application-pod will contact the another namespace's service


Steps: 
1. deploy the db - in the database namespace
2. expose the service
3. expose the service which contacts with the service of the first namespace
4. build the app and run the pod of the service
